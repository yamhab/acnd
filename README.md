So I have this school math assignment where I have to make a board/card game with integer operations involved.

I decided to make a video game (of course).

## let AC be Academically Challenged in: AC NERD DUELS

The game is still being made, and I have to finish it in about two weeks. How I want the game to:
* Be similar to turn based fighter games like Pokemon and Prodigy (ew).
* Have multiple nerds (characters/classes) to choose from with different specialties, like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, hero shooters, etc.
* Have humor; after all, the demographic is a bunch of nerdy thirteen year olds,
* Involve math by making all damage/health/multipliers taken and given be a math expression that has to be solved; otherwise, you fail.
* Be simple and not complicated: probably the only slightly complex mechanic should be multipliers. I only have two weeks to finish a polished game.
